# My Nature Study Tool

Using this template, students conduct and communicate their Nature Study while learning the basics of html, css, and bootstrap which includes reponsive design and cool tools like modal views. 

Organizationally, this tool encourages students to name and describe their work to refine its presentation. Pedagologically, this portfolio requires students to argue how the work in the portfolio demonstrates their concerted effort to meet course goals.
