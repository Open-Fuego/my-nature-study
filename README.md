# My Nature Study Tool

Nature studies offer Finnish students time to engage with nature and to learn about their own environmental impact. Finnish schools adopt a transdisciplinary approach to understanding environmental education, which contrasts with the U.S. approaches, where environmental education is almost solely taught during science courses and touched on only briefly through earth science standards. By un-disciplining environmental education, Finnish citizens have some of the most advanced content knowledge as it relates to climate change, and their policies, cultural practices, and aesthetics reflect that knowledge.

We've adapted the holistic, nature-centered methods we witnessed in the field to create My Nature Study, a coding template offering students an opportunity to work with tools to construct meaning in their world. Through this project of languaging and communicating their relationship with the natural environment, students will learn essential computer science concepts and learn to read/edit .html and .css documents.
 
### This template includes responsive design and cool tools like modal views. 

**-Commune with Nature**

**-Use Tools to construct meaning**
